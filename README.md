The main problem is we're going to be dealing with a smaller data set that can be classified into many more classes,this can make it a lot more difficult for our network to learn properly with a high accuracy rate.That being said, preprocessing these images in a correct way is going to be crucial to our success. Pre processing and preparing data sets is extremely important in the field of deep learning.

We will use a new technique for dealing with smaller data sets that will allow our network to learn more effectively.
